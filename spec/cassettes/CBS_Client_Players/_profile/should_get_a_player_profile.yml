        <a href=\"http://fantasynews.cbssports.com/fantasyfootball/teams/page/PHI\">Eagles</a>,
        as expected, drafted rookie quarterback <a href=\"http://moderndad.football.cbssports.com/players/playerpage/1907522\">Carson
        Wentz</a> at No. 2 overall in the NFL Draft from North Dakota State. He''s
        expected to be the starting quarterback in Philadelphia for many years to
        come, and he could even be the starter in Week 1 against Cleveland after the
        Eagles traded Sam Bradford to Minnesota just before the start of the season.
        Wentz has plenty of upside based on his successful career with the Bison when
        he passed for 5,115 yards, 45 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in four years.
        He could develop into a quality Fantasy quarterback, but we don''t expect
        it to happen during his rookie season. He''s not worth drafting in most re-draft
        leagues, but he is worth taking with a second- or third-round pick in rookie-only
        drafts. But if he gets off to a good start during his rookie campaign then
        add him off waivers.","modified":null},"firstname":"Carson","photo":"http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/football/nfl/players/170x170/1907522.png","position":"QB","icons":{"headline":"Eagles''

        his rookie season, throwing for 3,782 yards and 16 touchdowns on 379-for-607
        passing. The team is unsure if Wentz''s throwing motion or the sheer number
        of passes were the reason for his elbow soreness, but the issue was significant
        enough that the young passer had to take additional time off from throwing
        after the season ended. The soreness won''t in any way impact his availability
        for offseason workouts, but it may be something the team tries to avoid in
        the future.</p>","type":null,"id":"c22a2d80-91e3-46b3-a4be-39185d637ef2","title":"Eagles''
